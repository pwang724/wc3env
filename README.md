# wc3env

A gym-style environment for real Warcraft III Legacy on Windows. An injected DLL provides
deterministic stepping, fog-filtered observations and native commands on stock maps, with
offline self-play and pools of independent game processes.

```python
from wc3env import GameConfig, WC3Env

with WC3Env(GameConfig(map="(2)EchoIsles.w3x", step_ms=1000)) as env:
    obs = env.reset()
    worker = next(u for u in obs["units"] if u["type_id"] == "hpea")
    move = {"unit_id": worker["unit_id"], "command": "move", "arguments": {"x": worker["x"] - 400, "y": worker["y"]}}
    obs, done, info = env.step([move])
    print(obs["game_time_seconds"], len(obs["units"]), info["rejected"])
```

## Setup

1. Install **Warcraft III - Legacy TFT 1.29** from the Game Version dropdown in Battle.net
   ([announcement](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/warcraft3/t/warcraft-iii-legacy-the-frozen-throne-129-now-available/38037)).
   The supported build is `1.29.2.9232-legacy-tft`; the launcher verifies the executable's
   SHA-256 before injecting. The client also needs its activation files (`roc.w3k`,
   `tft.w3k`) in the installation folder, or it opens a CD-key dialog.
2. Use Windows x64, 64-bit Python 3.11+ and Visual Studio Build Tools (Desktop development
   with C++) to build the 32-bit hook.
3. Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env` and set `WC3_GAME_DIR`.

```powershell
wc3hook/build.bat
python -m pip install -e .
python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit -t .
python -m tests.e2e                             # real game, ~3 min; skipped without an installation
```

`render=False` still needs Direct3D 9 and a window/device; see
[rendering and input](docs/design.md#rendering-and-input). Linux workers run the same
environment under Wine: see [docker/](docker/README.md).

## Use

Two agents sharing one simulation:

```python
from wc3env import GameConfig, GameSession, PlayerConfig

with GameSession(GameConfig(players=(PlayerConfig(0), PlayerConfig(1)))) as session:
    observations = session.reset()
    observations, done, info = session.step({0: [], 1: []})
```

`reset()` reloads the map in-process and periodically recycles the process to bound memory.
Map and agent slots are fixed at launch; `session.setup` reports the accepted configuration.
For independent games use `StepPool.launch(n, speed, config=...)`, or try the CLI:
`python -m wc3env --instances 8 --steps 200 --speed 64`.

Each game process writes logs and replays to its own directory (`game.data_dir`), by default
under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/wc3env`. Choose another parent with
`GameConfig(output_dir=...)` or `WC3_OUTPUT_DIR`; the explicit argument wins.
`session.save_replay(path)` writes the finished episode as a native `.w3g` that the game, or this
environment, can play back.

## Agent

The LLM agent in [`wc3agent/`](wc3agent/README.md) needs two keys in `.env`: `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`
for Jev (micro), and a macro model: `MACRO_PROVIDER` (`anthropic`, or `openai` for any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint), `MACRO_MODEL` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```powershell
python -m pip install -e . -e wc3agent
python -m wc3agent duels human --runs 1 --visible --realtime       # Jev in a mirror duel
python -m wc3agent melee --race orc --difficulty insane --realtime # a full game against the Insane AI
```
